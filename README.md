# Scene Recognition with Deep Learning
In this project, we use CNNs to classify images into different scenes. Our objectives of this project include constructing the fundamental pipeline for performing deep learning using PyTorch, understanding the concepts behind different layers, optimizers, and experimenting with different models and observe the performance.
